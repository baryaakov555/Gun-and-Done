**Features**

* Two Gun Modes:

  * Push Mode (Red): Shoot surfaces to launch yourself using recoil.
  * Echo Mode (Blue): Shoot surfaces to teleport: First bounce would mark the spot, second bounce would instantly teleport you there.
  * If no second bounce within 3 seconds --> teleport to the first marked spot.
* Physics-based Movement: No traditional controls — every jump, climb, and dash is powered by your shots.
* Punishing Progression: No lives, no power-ups — success depends entirely on skill.
* Speedrunning Focus: Restart instantly, track progress with a "big fall" counter, and aim for flawless runs.
